## Overview

CNVxplorer is a user-friendly web application developed to assist in the clinical interpretation of CNVs. For this purpose, CNVxplorer provides the user with the following main features:

## Features 

* Query a genomic interval, cytoband, or upload a file with multiple genomic regions and analyze it simultaneously.
* Compare the genetic evidence of disease genes from five different databases (OMIM, ORPHANET, ClinGen, DECIPHER, and Genomics England PanelApp).
* Explore CNV syndromes, pathogenic and non-pathogenic CNVs, disease variants (ClinVar, GWAS), and denovo variants (denovo.db) that overlap with the CNVs.
* Find regulatory elements disrupted by the variant and their target genes.
* Consider those target genes that do not map the input variant(s) in the subsequent analysis (optional).
* Identify relevant diseases and genes based on phenotypic similarity with the clinical characteristics of the patient.
* Check the phenotype of the orthologous genes in experiments with mouse models.
* Find PubMed articles related to your variants and filter the relevant ones by keyword, number of citations, or by association with the OMIM database.
