We provide instructions to install CNVxplorer locally or on a server (through Docker) with just 3 lines of code:

## Docker installation (recommended)

``` bash

# Note: the first session after the deployment is slower since the application loads all the data required

git clone https://github.com/frequena/cnvxplorer.git

docker build -t cnvxplorer . # The tag "cnvxplorer" is optional

docker run -d -p 3838:3838 cnvxplorer # -p (specify the port) -d (detached mode)

# The port 3838 is optional. Please make sure you set a port that
# is not blocked by firewalls. Also, if you change 3838 for any other port, you need to specify it before 
# in the Dockerfile (EXPOSE instruction)
```

### Local installation

``` bash

git clone https://github.com/frequena/cnvxplorer.git

cd cnvxplorer

gunzip -c local_data.RData.gz > local_data.RData

R -e 'load('local_data.RData')'

# Once you loaded the R environment with the files and functions
# comment the same two lines above in global.R so the app doesn't need
# to load the data every session but only once.

# Make sure you have all the packages installed
R -e 'shiny:runApp()'
```


For any technical problem, please open a issue on the Github page, we will be happy to help :).
